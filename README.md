## Live URL: https://fueled-student.web.app/

This project aims to develop a Hostel Management system for a university using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The system enables administrators to manage student meals and food reviews efficiently while enhancing the student experience in the university hostel.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: Students can log in to view and review meals, while administrators have access to manage meal data and reviews.
2. **Meal Management**: Administrators can Post, edit, or delete meal data, including upcoming meals and published meals.
3. **Premium Packages**: Users can subscribe to premium packages with additional features, facilitated by Stripe integration for payment processing.
4. **Dashboard**: User-friendly dashboard design for administrators to manage users, assign admin privileges, and view order lists.
5. **Review System**: Users can give reviews for meals, which are displayed in a table format on their dashboard and can be managed by administrators.
6. **Search and Filter**: Includes a robust search and filtering system for finding data easily.
7. **Security JWT**: Implementation of security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent common vulnerabilities.
8. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms throughout the application with informative error messages for users.
9. **Data Validation**: Validation of user inputs to prevent data manipulation or injection attacks.
10. **Authorization**: Enforced user roles and permissions to control access to functionalities based on user type.
